# Meeting Dates 

Meetings are every X weeks on a **day-of-the-week** at TIME.

The dates for upcoming meetings are here, but the discussion material will be voted for in the meeting before. 

We will meet on Zoom - the link will be sent out on the [mailing list](), and on the individual meeting pages that you can click to below.
Each week we will try to provide a summary on Twitter or HackMD of what we discussed.
