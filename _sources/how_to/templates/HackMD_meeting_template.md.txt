### :arrow_forward: What's this document?

#### :writing_hand: Let's write together!
We're trying to write up these discussions and include input from everyone.
We hope you'll join us and help us to make any write-ups of the discussion a little more representative of everyone's point of view.

We also hope that through doing this, we'll open up the possibility for more collaborative writing together in the future, e.g. through a perspective article.
That's if there's any appetite from you to do that.

#### :computer: Writing in Markdown
We're using HackMD to write a collaborative Markdown document. 
Markdown is a format for writing text that displays nicely on websites.
On the left you can edit, and on the right you can see view.

#### :grey_question: Getting Markdown help
There is a question mark symbol at the top of the screen that will bring up a cheat sheet, e.g. *write between single asterixes to write in italics* **or double asterixes for bold**.
You can also use the buttons at the top of the edit panel.

Please make space for one another to talk - keep your eyes open :eyes: for people with their hands up :hand: and invite them to talk.

As always we have provided some discussion points to get the conversation moving, but feel free to discuss anything relating to the materials!
