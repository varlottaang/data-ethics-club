2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository to your own GitHub account
3. Check that you are happy with the changes by [building the site locally](#build-the-site-locally).
4. Then, once you've made your changes, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request): we'll review it as quick as we can ðŸ˜„.

### Build the site locally
In order to build the site locally, you'll need to run the following from your root directory:
`sphinx-build site/ site/_build/` 

These require some Python packages to run. 
You may want to set up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) first, so that you don't install these packages system-wide.
Then you can install the packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
