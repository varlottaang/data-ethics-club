# Join us

Everyone is welcome to get involved in Data Ethics Club, as much or as little as you'd like to! 
We would love to [hear your point of view at our discussion groups](#attend-our-discussion-groups), to have your support in [organising or running a meeting](#help-us-to-organise), or to add your [suggestions](#suggest-something-for-our-reading-list) to our reading list.

## Attend our discussion groups

### What to expect
We meet every other week (Wednesdays, 1pm, UK time) to talk about something from [the reading list](reading-list).
Meetings last one hour and are held on Zoom. 

We usually hear a short summary of the piece, split into breakout rooms to discuss some prompts, and then come back together to share our thoughts as a group. 
You don't need to be a data ethicist (we're not!), or a data scientist. 
Everyone is welcome to contribute to the discussion, which is how we learn from each other.
It's a friendly and welcoming group and we often have new people drop by, so why not try it? 
We'd love to have you there!

If you'd like a flavour of what we usually discuss then go to [our meetings page](meetings/meetings) and click on any of the summaries from past meetings to read about our discussions.

### How to join us
If you'd like to join us, we email the Zoom link and discussion material 1 week ahead of, and on the day of, our meetings to [our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/hjkmnX). 
You can also look at [our meetings page](meetings/meetings) to see upcoming dates. 
The Zoom link can be found by clicking through to a specific upcoming meeting.

### Code of conduct
We follow a [code of conduct](code-of-conduct) during Data Ethics Group which is designed to make sure everyone feels welcome and confortable sharing their experiences and take on the material. 
Please read it before attending.

### Special events
We occasionally have special events with slightly different formats, for example our [Coded Bias Screening]() or our [Inclusive Data Science event](). 
We will send information about these events to the mailing list, too, and explain how they'll be different.

## Suggest something for our reading list
We keep a reading list to help us decide what to read and discuss next, and to help people who are interested in Data Ethics find some interesting starting points!

- __Think of a video, blog post, white paper or journal article relating to ethics and data science__ - this can anything from be the impact of algorithms on the people who are deploying them, to the ethics of surveillance and buying/selling personal data, to a more technical paper on the specifics of an explainable AI algorithm.
- (Optional) __Suggest 3 discussion questions to kick-start conversation__ - See [our past meetings](meetings/meetings) for examples of the sorts of questions we usually ask.
- __Let us know__ by opening [a new Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues/new?assignees=NatalieThurlby&labels=reading+suggestion&template=reading-suggestion.md&title=%5BSUGGESTION%28S%29%5D+You+suggestion%28s%29+here) or by [emailing us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk).
