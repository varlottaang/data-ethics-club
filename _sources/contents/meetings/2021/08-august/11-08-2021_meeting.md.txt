### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday 11th August at 1pm](LINK-TO-TIMEDATE). You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to watch/read [What an ancient lake in Nevada reveals about the future of tech](https://www.fastcompany.com/90618225/what-an-ancient-lake-in-nevada-reveals-about-the-future-of-tech) by Kate Crawford, which is a short piece about the environmental impact of technology. It is an extract from her recent book [Atlas of AI](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300209570/atlas-ai).

Natalie suggested this week's content, and Nina will be leading this week's meeting.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- What information or knowledge are we missing in terms of environmental impact of technology that might help us to act on it? 
- Who does this problem 'belong to'? 
- What can we do about it?
