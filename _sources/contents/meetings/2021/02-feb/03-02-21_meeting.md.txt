### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on Wednesday the 3rd Feb 2021 at [1-2pm GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club&iso=20210203T13&p1=299&ah=1). 
You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to read [Ethics canâ€™t be a side hustle](https://deardesignstudent.com/ethics-cant-be-a-side-hustle-b9e78c090aee) 
by Mike Monteiro. It's in the form of a blog post, and dicusses our personal responsibilities to act ethically in all of our work, not just some of the time. 

Natalie suggested this week's content, and Nina will be leading the meeting.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- How do the themes of this blog apply to your own work - for instance, are there times you have been faced with ethical dilemmas? 
- How well do you think academia encourages/discourages ethical data science?
- In an ideal world, what questions would we be asking ourselves before moving forward with a project?
