### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on Wednesday 12th May at [1pm BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club+-+Computer+Vision&iso=20210512T13&p1=%3A&ah=1). You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to watch/read [Critical Perspectives on Computer Vision](https://slideslive.com/38923500/critical-perspectives-on-computer-vision) by Emily Denton, which is a 20 minute presentation from NeurIPS 2019. 

Natalie suggested this week's content, and Nina will be leading this week's meeting.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Denton talks about the 'view from nowhere' as a "neutral" perspective of research, and specifically data annotation. If you were building a new dataset right now, what could you do, or what have you done previously, to address this?
- Denton discusses the implications of [biological essentialism](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095507973#:~:text=The%20belief%20that%20'human%20nature,%2C%20upbringing%2C%20and%20culture). Many areas of research have 'controlled for' gender and race/ethnicity for a long time - is this the most useful way to understand differences between people?
- What current applications of computer vision can we think of that are currently in use? What implications might these have for people's lives?
