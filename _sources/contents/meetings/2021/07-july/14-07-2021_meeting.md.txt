### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [14-07-21 Wednesday 13:00-14:00 UK time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club+14%2F07%2F21%3A+Numberphile+mathematics+of+crime+&iso=20210717T13&p1=299&ah=1). 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch an episode of Numberphile [The Mathematics of Crime and Terrorism - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCjspXB5F4A) by with Hannah Fry, which is a ten minute video describing how statistical modelling equations are used in predictive policing. 

Thank you to our new addition to the organising team Huw Day for suggesting this week's content, and to Natalie Thurlby, who'll be leading this week's meeting.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- What ethical concerns would you have about this kind of predictive policing being implemented?
- What do you think about Hannah's statement that the process of modelling is "free from emotion and hand-wavey-ness"?
- How do you think the the fact that predictive policing is being used impact on crime rates?
