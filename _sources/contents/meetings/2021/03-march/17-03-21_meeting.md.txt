### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on Wednesday the 17th March at [1-2pm GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club%3A+Bropen+science+is+broken+science&iso=20210317T13&p1=299&ah=1). You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to read [#bropenscience is broken science](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/november-2020/bropenscience-broken-science) by Kirstie Whitaker and Olivia Guest, which is a short paper arguing for a more inclusive definition of Open Science, and a more inclusive culture within Open Science communities. 

Natalie suggested this week's content, and will lead this week's meeting.

### Discussion points
There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- (When) have you noticed or experienced a "bro"-like culture in Open Science, reproducibility, data science, or your area of work/study?
- What do you think about the idea that "bros find it hard to understand – or accept – that others will have a different lived experience"? 
- What did you think about the suggested actions in the paper? Would you take these? Why or why not?


## Meeting notes

### Who came
Number of people: 22

### What did we think?
100% of people enjoyed the paper, and all but one would recommend it to another group. 
We're writing up a HackMD summary of this week's discussion - stay tuned!
