### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday the 6th October at 1pm-2pm UK time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club%3A+Structural+injustice+and+individual+responsibility&iso=20211006T13&p1=299&ah=1). You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to listen to  an episode of The Philosopher's Zone podcast, with guest professor in Philosophy Robin Zheng discussing "[Structural injustice and individual responsibility](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/structural-injustice-and-individual-responsibility/13486680)".

Thank you to Kamilla Wells for suggesting this week's content!

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- **Q1**: What do you see as the structural injustices in data science, compared to the injustices that are largely out of data scientists control? For example, which is using balanced training data, or writing work thats more likely to get funded in research?
- **Q2**: Who is attributable for harmful deployments of data science? (E.g. The original researchers? The company who sold it? The government who bought and deployed it?) And who is accountable?
- **Q3**: Thinking about how Robin describes the role ideal model, how could individuals in the role of data scientist, publisher, funder, company, or government use their role to push boundaries?
