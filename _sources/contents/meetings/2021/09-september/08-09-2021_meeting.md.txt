### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [8th September at 1pm UK time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club%3A+Ethics+and+Society+Review+of+Artificial+Intelligence&iso=20210908T13&p1=299&ah=1).
You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to read [ESR: Ethics and Society Review of Artificial Intelligence Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11521) by Michael Bernstein and colleagues, which is a paper describing a new model of ethically reviewing research projects, that goes beyond typical ethical review processes in universities to consider wider societal impact. 

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Do you have a general view about the ESR, and how much it adds to a typical ethical review processes for AI research? 
- What did you think about the reactions of researchers to the ESR process? 
- The ESR is based around universities and research funding; would something like this work in other types of organisations - why/why not?
