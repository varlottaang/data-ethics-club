:alt: The Data Ethics Club logo - a teal hex-sticker lablled "Data Ethics Club" showing binary in darker teal with some numbers coloured pink-red to show a heart. The binary reads 01100101 01110100 01101000 01101001 01100011 01110011 which converts to "ethics".

```{admonition} Welcome to Data Ethics Club
:class: tip
__Data Ethics Club__ is a "journal" club about doing data science ethically. 
"Journal" because we will also read blog posts, (parts of) books, or watch videos. 

The club is open to all and we are lucky to have attendees from around the world and with diverse expertise, from practising lawyers, to data analysts in the UK National Health Service, to social scientists, to Research Software Engineers in the USA. 
Everyone is welcome to come and discuss Data Science and Ethics with us: and we look forward to learning from your perspective.

We send out regular reminders of our meetings to [our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/hjkmnX), so joining it is the best way to regularly hear about [our upcoming meetings](contents/upcoming-meetings).
