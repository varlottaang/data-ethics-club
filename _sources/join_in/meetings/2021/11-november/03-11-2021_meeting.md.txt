### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [3rd November at 1pm UK time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club+-+National+AI+Strategy&iso=20211103T13&p1=299&ah=1). You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to watch/read the new [UK National AI Strategy - Pillar 3: Governing AI Effectively](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy/national-ai-strategy-html-version#pillar-3-governing-ai-effectively). 

Thank you to Paul Lee for suggesting this week's content!

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Which proposals were you most pleased to see from the report? Are there any that you do not think will be welcomed?  
- How do you see regulation as potentially impacting your work? If you are not UK based, are there similarities/differences with any of your national regulations?  
- The report states that they want to build the "most trusted and pro-innovation system for AI governance in the world" - can both these things be true?
