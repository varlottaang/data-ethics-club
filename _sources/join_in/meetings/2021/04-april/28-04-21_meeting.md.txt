### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on Wednesday 28th April at [1-2 BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club+-+We+created+poverty.+Algorithms+won%27t+make+that+go+away.&iso=20210428T13&p1=299&ah=1). 
You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to read [We created poverty. Algorithms won't make that go away](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/13/we-created-poverty-algorithms-wont-make-that-go-away)
by Virginia Eubanks (author of [Automating Inequality](https://virginia-eubanks.com/)), which is a short opinion piece in The Guardian about the role of AI in 'fixing' poverty and inequality.

Thank you to Matthew West for suggesting this week's content, and providing the questions and summary.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
1. Think of a time when you were in serious need of help. Where would you put yourself on the "spectrum of deservingness" of assistance? Is this a reasonable question?
2. In projects that involve direct impacts on people's lives, does everything need to be automated and optimized?
3. In what ways can data-scientists positively contribute to poverty-relief projects and avoid reinforcing societal inequalities by outsourcing our ethical choices to machines?
