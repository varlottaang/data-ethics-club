### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday the 20th October at 1pm-2pm UK time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+Club%3A+20%2F10%2F21&iso=20211020T13&p1=299&ah=1). 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch/read [Towards decolonising computational sciences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14258.pdf) which is a paper by Abeba Birhane and Olivia Guest - relevant to [this week's (UK) headlines](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58795079) and for [UK Black History Month](https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/).

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Q1: What does it mean to decolonise something?Â 
- Q2: What did you find the most and least persuading argument in this paper?
- Q3: What could you/your organisation do to decolonise data science/data analysis/computer science? (If it's not relevant to your role, then what would you do as a data scientist?)
