### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [21st September 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch/read [Hacking the cis-tem][content] by Mar Hicks (they/them), which is an article that looks at the case of transgender Britons who tried to correct the gender listed on their government-issued ID cards, but were limited by computerised systems. 

### Discussion points

Check back soon for discussion points on this piece. 

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.  
1. How can the construction and manipulation of identity categories by computerised systems lead to discrimination? Can you think of a time you’ve been guilty of this practice?  
2. What are the risks of AI systems artificial intelligence systems that are designed to “discern” or algorithmically “identify” aspects like gender or sexuality from facial data or other categories?  
3. What responsibility do government and/or technological platforms have when constructing such computerised systems?
