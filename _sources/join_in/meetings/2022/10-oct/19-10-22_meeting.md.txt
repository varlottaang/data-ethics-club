[Zoom link][zoom]

Content: [Patient and public involvement to build trust in artificial intelligence: A framework, tools, and case studies][content] 

### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [19th October, 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch/read [Patient and public involvement to build trust in artificial intelligence: A framework, tools, and case studies][content] by Dr Soumya Banerjee and colleagues, about how research advisory groups can be used to build trust in, and create more ethical, AI-health research.

The piece this week is a little bit longer, so you could just stick to the following two sections if you're short on time:
- Framework for building trust and typical patient concerns
- Discussion

### Discussion points

Questions to think about:
- Do you agree that it is important to increase public and patient trust in AI?
- What would you consider good evidence that research advisory groups are successful in their aims of more ethical and/or trustworthy research? 
- Is there anything that you think research advisory groups should not have a say in? Or anything that they donâ€™t have a say in that you think they should?
