### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [5th October, 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch/read [The Failures of Algorithmic Fairness][content] by Paul Lee, which is a blog about the complications of trying to achieve fairness in algorithmic systems. 

Thank you to Paul Lee who wrote this blog post!

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- What do you think we lose or gain from trying to make our lives more and more efficient?
- What different ways could we measure 'fairness'?
- Is there an acceptable level of fairness we could require before releasing new technologies? How would this work in practice?
