### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [DAY the DATE at TIME UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch/read ['The data was there – so why did it take coronavirus to wake us up to racial health inequalities?'][content] by Angela Saini author of [Superior: The Return of Race Science](https://guardianbookshop.com/superior-9780008293864).

Thank you to Dr Euan Bennet for suggesting this week's content!

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Did you know the maternal mortality rates discussed in the article? Were you surprised?
- Saini discusses how race is misunderstood as a biological concept when it is actually a social one. What implications should this have for the way we measure and record 'race'?
- Saini also refers to the overlapping of different inequalities and privileges in different contexts. How does this intersectionality of identities impact the way we do or should analyse data about demographics?
