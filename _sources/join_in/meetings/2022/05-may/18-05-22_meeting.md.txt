### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [18th May at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch/read [Why Data Is Never Raw][content] by Nick Barrowman, which is an essay about the objectivity of data and the reprocussions of that for data-driven decision-making.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.

- Can You think of any examples of data that you would consider truly "raw"?
- How "raw" or "cooked" is the data that you work with/that is used in your organisation?
- What would an ideal process for decision making be in your opinion? How much would it rely on data or politics? How would this vary by the type of decision?
