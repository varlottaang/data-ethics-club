### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday 9th March at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to watch [““AI in Warfare”][content]: an engaging 30-minute lecture by Computer Scientist Stuart Russell, which is part of the Living with Artificial Intelligence serious of Reith Lectures. Thank you Sergio for making this suggestion!

We voted for this lecture before Russia invaded the Ukraine, and in light of this, the topic may have additional relevance, emotional weight, or both. We’d like to encourage our participants to remember that the topic of war might have personal relevance for their fellow attendees, which may be related to any armed conflict across the world. As always, we expect participants to adhere to our Code of Conduct.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- __Q1:__ To what extent were you aware that lethal autonomous weapons were already purchasable?
- __Q2:__ In your opinion, is there a valid argument that lethal autonomous weapons could reduce negative outcomes? Is this different for civilians versus soldiers?
- __Q3:__ Who do you think would be held responsible for the implementation of a lethal autonomous weapon? What would count as criminal intent versus criminal negligence?
