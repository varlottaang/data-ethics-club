### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [6th April 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to watch/read [The Algorithmic Colonization of Africa][content] by Abeba Birhane. 

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Birhane states that tech solutions are made on the basis of utilitarianism - “the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people,” - which means that solutions that center minorities are never sought. Do you agree, and what are the alternatives?
- How does [White Saviourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior) show up in the pursuit of tech solutions for social good?
- What Western ideals influence the way we build technology in the Global North? What should we be doing to learn more effectively from other parts of the world?
