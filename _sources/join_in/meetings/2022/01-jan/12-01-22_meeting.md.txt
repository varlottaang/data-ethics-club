### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [12th January, 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 

This meeting will be a little different to usual. 
We're going to use our first meeting of 2022 to reflect on everything we've read and discussed over the past year, and come up with some personal resolutions for the year ahead on the theme of data ethics.
These might be big resolutions, or small ones, but they should be about what you can do to make data science more ethical.

Data Ethics Club should inspire change in the way we practice as data scientists, and so this will be some time set aside for us to think about just that!
To get you started, or if you're stuck, have a read of Virginia Eubank's [Hippocratic Oath for Data Science][content]. 

You might also find these [self-reflection prompts for data scientists](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/self-reflection/sr-prompts.html) in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) helpful. 

Please have a think before you come along about what your resoutions might be, and be prepared to share them if you are comfortable to. 
You might inspire someone else!

We really look forward to seeing you.
