You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [26th Jan at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to watch/read [Which Programming Languages Use the Least Electricity?][content] by David Cassel, which is a blog post discussing results from a research study that looked at the electricity useage of various programming languages. 
Natalie suggested this piece - thanks! 

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- Are you surprised by any of the results?
- Which languages do you use, and how do they rate?
- Is changing our programming practices an effective way to reduce our environmental footprint?
