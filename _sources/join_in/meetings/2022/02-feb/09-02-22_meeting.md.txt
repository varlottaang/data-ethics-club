### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [9th Feb at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. This time we're going to watch/read [“You Social Scientists Love Mind Games”: Experimenting in the “divide” between data science and critical algorithm studies][content] by David Moats and Nick Seaver, which is (very simplistically) a piece about the relationship between data science and sociology, and why learning from critical algorithm studies doesn't translate back to action on the part of data scientists. 

Thank you to Ola Michalec for suggesting this piece!

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- __Q1:__ What do you think about the authors’ approach (framing of the experiment, the first vs the second attempt, tools suggested, their reflections, Nick’s email)?
- __Q2:__ Going beyond data sci-social sci divide: What other divides, binaries and camps should we pay attention to?
- __Q3:__ What intervention could we stage in this group?
