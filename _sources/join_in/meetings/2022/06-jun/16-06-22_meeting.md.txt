## Meeting info

### Quick links

[Zoom link][zoom]

Content: no homework this week, we'll watch this [Virginia Eubanks video](content) during the session.

### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Thursday the 16th June at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You can pop in even if you didn't register.
This time we're going to discuss a [Virginia Eubanks video about Automating Inequality][content] - it's a great place to jump in if you haven't joined us before.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the video, but here are some specific questions that can get started with:
1. What are the pros and cons of automating decisions that affect people's lives using algorithms compared to having humans make these decisions? What risks could be associated with "flattening" people's stories into data?
2. How can we better listen to the voices of those currently targetted by automated decision algorithms, i.e. primarily people in low rights environments?
3. Have you previously experienced any examples of "maths washing" of systems and problems addressed by automated systems?
