### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [Wednesday the 1st June at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 
This time we're going to read a report from the Ada Lovelace Institute about [Participatory Data Stewardship][content], which provides an overview of the different types of engagement and ownership people can have with their data. 
The report is fairly long, and so we recommend if you are very short on time just look at the helpful overview image on Page 14 and table on Pages 17-18. 
If you have a bit more time then have a look over the descriptions of each type and case studies on Pages 19-47.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
- What factors should guide decisions about what level of participation best suits a project? Does this happen in practice?
- Do different types of participation privilege different people or perspectives? Is the most participation always the best?
- What do you see as being barriers to participatory data stewardship, and how could these realistically be overcome?
