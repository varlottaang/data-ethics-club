### Description
You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics Club meeting on [25th January at 1pm UK time][timedate]. 
You don't need to register, just pop in. 

This meeting will be a little different to usual, and we'll have it in two halves. 
Data Ethics Club should inspire change in the way we practice as data scientists, and so this will be some time set aside for us to think about just that!

1. Personal data ethics resolutions
We're going to use our first meeting of 2023 to reflect and come up with some personal resolutions for the year ahead on the theme of data ethics.
Those of us who were here for last years meeting might also like to [go back to last year's write up and see what we said we would do last year](https://dataethicsclub.com/write_ups/2022/12-01-22_writeup.html) - have you achieved what you set out to?

These might be big resolutions, or small ones, but they should be about what you can do to make data science more ethical.


2. Resolutions for Data Ethics Club

Next, we wanted to talk about our hopes for Data Ethics Club. 
What things would you like us to do differently, or in addition to how we currently work? 
Also we wanted to invite topics to discuss over the coming year - maybe you'd like to present your work to the group for discussion, or see more of something specific. 

If there's anything that springs to mind, or feedback you've been meaning to give us then this is the time! 

We really look forward to seeing you!
